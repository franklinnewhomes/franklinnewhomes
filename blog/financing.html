Financing a new construction home is slightly different than purchasing an existing property.
Understanding the process upfront can save you time, stress, and money.
</p>

<h3>Mortgage Pre-Approval</h3>
<p>
Most builders require pre-approval before entering a contract. This helps lock in your budget
and strengthens your negotiating position.
</p>

<h3>Construction-to-Permanent Loans</h3>
<p>
Some buyers use construction loans that convert into a traditional mortgage once the home is completed.
These loans simplify financing but require careful planning.
</p>

<h3>Builder Incentives</h3>
<p>
Many builders offer incentives such as closing cost credits or upgrade allowances when you use
their preferred lender.
</p>

<h3>Down Payments & Closing Costs</h3>
<p>
Expect to budget for down payments ranging from 5–20%, depending on loan type, along with closing costs
and optional upgrades.
