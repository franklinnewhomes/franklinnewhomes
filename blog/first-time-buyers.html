Buying your first home is an exciting milestone — especially in a market like Franklin, Tennessee.
With strong schools, growing neighborhoods, and excellent new construction options, Franklin is
an ideal place to start homeownership.
</p>

<h3>1. Get Pre-Approved Before You Shop</h3>
<p>
Pre-approval helps you understand your budget and shows builders that you are a serious buyer.
It also prevents disappointment by keeping your search realistic.
</p>

<h3>2. Understand the New Construction Timeline</h3>
<p>
Unlike existing homes, new construction can take several months. Knowing this upfront allows you
to plan your move and finances properly.
</p>

<h3>3. Choose a Reputable Builder</h3>
<p>
Not all builders are the same. Look for builders with strong reputations, quality craftsmanship,
and transparent communication throughout the process.
</p>

<h3>4. Budget for More Than the Base Price</h3>
<p>
Upgrades, closing costs, and design selections can add up. Make sure you understand what’s included
and what’s optional before signing a contract.
</p>

<h3>5. Work With Experts Who Know Franklin</h3>
<p>
Local experts understand Franklin’s neighborhoods, pricing trends, and builder incentives —
helping you make confident decisions.
